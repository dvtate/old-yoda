## Viewing and Editing YodaScript files:
Until your text editor adds syntax highlighting for YodaScript, I've found that
Tcl has a similar enough syntax to where it will at least highlight correctly.

I will be working on plugins for a variety of editors which will add syntax highlighting
for YodaScript in the near future.

**Planned editor plugins:**
- nano
- atom
