# Hi there, this is awkward
This repo contains poorly written code (lots of it). Because this project spanned multiple years of me learning C/C++, there are poor design choices made early on that have forced me into doing a [complete rewrite of the interpreter](https://github.com/dvtate/ys-alpha). Once I'm finished implementing all the features (including the ones that only worked sometimes) of this interpreter, I'll probably rename this repo to indicate it's defunct.

Also will update readme on new repo with syntax changes and such.

# YodaScript / RPN Shell
A YodaScript (.ys) interpreter which is now turing complete! The language is dynamically typed, and although it has a rather unique syntax, those familiar to RPN may prefer it to other languages. This is just a side project of mine suggestions and help are welcome. Using the shell, it can be used as a calculator by those familiar with RPN.

# Build and Run [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dvtate/yoda.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dvtate/yoda/)
For Arch Linux users there is an [AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ys-git/) for this.
If you are a Windows user and are slightly confused, you can download this outdated executable
http://dvtate.github.io/dls/yoda.exe [updated 2017.6.4]
- Compiling:
`yoda $ make`
- Running:
`yoda $ ./yoda`
- Installing:
`yoda $ sudo make install`
- Uninstalling:
`yoda $ sudo make uninstall`

After installing, you can run yoda as you would any other program from the terminal.

# Types/Literals:
* Strings: `"literal enclosed in quotes"`: text
* Numbers: `1 1.0 inf 1e-4`: numerical values, or `true`=1/`false`=0
* Null: `null`: a placeholder for a lack of a value
* Reference: `$var`: a reference to another piece of data (or another reference)
* Macro/Block/Stack: `{ }`: a container of code/values which can be run (similar to functions)
* List: `("comma-separated","values",)`: an organized container of values (no value = null)
* Index (Intermediate type): `5 ]`: these are a part of the lazy-evaluation of list indicies.
* Lambdas: `{ } ($param1,$param2) lambda`: lambdas are first class functions and can be treated as normal data
* UserType: `{} object`: agregated data (lambdas are data) more commonly known as objects
* Member Request (Intermediate type): `:getName`: these are used to access object members


# How to use (note- may be out of date)
 - <b>Comments:</b>
   Anything after the `#` symbol will be ignored.
   ```Tcl
   >>> 32 # this is a comment
   32
   ```

 - <b>Binary operators:</b>
  Place the operator after it's two operands.
   ```Tcl
   >>> 1 2 +    # 1 + 2
   3
   >>> 2 5 **   # 2 ^ (5)
   32
   ```

 - <b>Unary operators:</b>
  place the unary operator/funciton behind it's parameter
  ```tcl
  >>> 100 log   # log10(100)
  2
  >>> 0.5 sin   # sine of 0.5 radians
  0.479426
  ```

 - <b>Combining operators:</b>
  One of postfix notation's main strengths is that it eliminates the need for parenthases. Simply combine operators in a way that would lead to them being performed sequentially.
  ```tcl
  >>> 1 1 + 2 *    # (1 + 1) * 2  
  4
  ```
 - <b>Variables:</b>
  Variables are created as soon as you start using them. All variable names must start with a `$` to prevent them from clashing with other keywords and literals. Here's an example:
```tcl
 >>> $a 4 =
 >>> $a print
 4
```
  Variables are references to data, variables can reference eachother. Changing the value of a reference changes the value  of it's referenced variable.  If you want to make a deep copy, use the copy operator (`~`). Also, note: this language uses dynamic scope resolution and variables are deleted as they go out of scope. If 2 variables in different scopes have the same name, the one in the more specific scope will be used.
```tcl
>>> $a 8 =    # now $a is a reference to the number 8
>>> $b $a =   # now $b is a reference to $a and $a is a reference to the number 8
>>> $b $a ~ = # now they are both references to the number 8
```
 - <b>Strings:</b>
  This is a loosely-typed language. Strings are enclosed in double quotes `"`
 ```tcl
 >>> "hello " "there" + $a = # notice that the `+` operator is overloaded
 >>> $a print
 hello there
 ```
 - <b>Macros:</b>
  Depending on the context these are also called anonymous subroutines. They are containers of code and function like most other data, working with operators. You can run the code in one with the `@` operator.
  ```tcl
  >>> $mySub {
    "hello there" print
    $a 5 =
  } =
  >>> $mySub @
  hello there
  >>> $a print # note, variables declared within the macro are deleted wen they go out of scope
  ERROR: broken reference to `$a`.
  ```

 - <b>Loops:</b>
  Loops can be used to repeat the code a number of times. This language has several types of loops built in.
  - <b>Repeat Loops:</b>
   runs code <i>n</i> times
   ```tcl
   >>> { "ha" print } 5 repeat
   hahahahaha
   ```
  - <b>While Loops:</b>
   runs core while a condition is met (checks before each cycle)
   ```tcl
   >>> $count 0 =    # set $count to 0
   >>> {
       "count is " $count + println
       $count $count 1 + =   # increment $count by 1
   } { $count 5 < } while
   count is 0
   count is 1
   count is 2
   count is 3
   count is 4
   ```
  - <b>for-each Loops:</b>
   assigns a variable to each element in an execuatable array
   ```tcl
   1>>> {
	     $num print  
   } (0, 1, 2, 3, 4) $num foreach
   01234
   ```
 - <b>Conditionals:</b>
  These can be used to run code if a condition is met
  ```tcl
  >>> "Enter GPA: " print $gpa input int =
  Enter GPA: 4
  >>> #this first method is syntactic sugar and slower than the second
  >>> { "You can do better than that." println 
  } else { 
      "That's good enough for me." println 
  } $gpa 3 >= elseif { 
      "Woooooooooooow!" println 
  } $gpa 4 >= if
  Woooooooooooow!
  ```
 - <b>Lists:</b>
  lists hold multiple pieces of data in one container. They contain diverse types and are handled like any other data.
  ```tcl
  >>> # use the get operator to get the value at an index of a list
  >>> (1,"hello",{ "hi" print }) 1 ] println
  hello
  ```
 - <b>Lambdas:</b>
  Lambdas are equivalent to arrow-functions in javascript.
  ```tcl
  >>> $fxn { $a print } ($a) lambda =
  >>> ("hello") $fxn @ # calling the lambda
  hello
  >>> # parameters are optional
  >>> # return pushes the last value and ends the lambda
  >>> { 5 return } () lambda @ print
  5
  >>> # break stops the lambda and carries the entire stack
  >>> { 4 5 break } () lambda @ + print
  9 
```
  - <b>Missing handlers:</b>
   These will run a macro if the parameter isn't provided as an argument. 
   ```tcl
   >>> $echo {
        { $msg println } 
            $msg is_defined if
   } (($msg, {
       "missing $msg" println 
   })) lambda =

   >>> ("hi") $echo @
   hi
   >>> $echo @
   missing $msg
   >>> () $echo @
   missing $msg
```
  - <b>Variable Arguments list:</b>
   If you have a function which needs to accept a variable number of arguments (ie - [printf](examples/printf.ys)), you can end your parameters list with a variable enclosed in a list, denoting a variable arguments list. If not called on anything, the variable is assigned to an empty list. 
   ```tcl
   >>> $sum {
        $total 0 = 
        { $total $n += } 
            $vals $n foreach
        $total return
    } (($vals)) lambda =
    >>> (1,2,3) $sum @
    6
    >>> $sum @
    0
```

 - OOP:
  - Making an Object:
   You can use the equals sign to define objects. The variable doesn't have to be defined in order to start adding members. The `:` operator is used to access object members. The object will be made around the member.
   ```tcl
   >>> $myObj :name "bob" =
   >>> $myObj :name print
   bob
   >>> # {} object makes an empty object constant
   >>> $myObj {} object =
   ```

# Related Repos & Gists
  When I develop the interpreter I like to develop different portions separately and then add them to my code-base once I've rigorously tested them. If you want to contribute to a particular sub-system, I'd reccomend editing these repos instead of this one. Eventually these will primarily be external libararies
